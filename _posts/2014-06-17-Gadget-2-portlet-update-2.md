GADGET-2 portlet update, Tuesday.

# SitRep
@vale-anna gave a brief update of the situation, this morning, describing particularly the QA of the GUI; started a Travis integration; 

Highlights are : 

  * The goals have been re-shuffled a bit, we have two milestones now : *"First Beta"* and *"First Beta of GUI"*. The First Beta of GUI milestone is to give us a pat on the shoulder for a functional GUI, assure ourselves that it's working and move onto backend integration with the GridEngine
  * We've added [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/SouthAfricaDigitalScience/GADGET-portlet) integration, which is attempting to configure the entire runtime environment - Liferay, MySQL, GridEngine - for the portlet. 
  
We'll be having a scrum meeting at 15:40 to go over the GridEngine functionality and finish work on the GUI, moving to the actual implementation of the submission.

# Feedback still required !
