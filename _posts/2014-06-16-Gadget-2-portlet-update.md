GADGET-2 portlet update, Monday.

During today's scrum meeting, we've given a brief SitRep and are planning the next iteration of development of the portlet. 

The portlet is passing the deploy test and there is a functional version of the GUI. We need some user feedback on the layout and validation of our approach. If you are interested, please send us a mail, or [open a ticket on github](https://github.com/SouthAfricaDigitalScience/GADGET-portlet/issues)

We've added some information to the wiki and README of the project, while planning the next iteration of development. @PrimoFurno and @vale-anna are doing some UX, while @ccarrubba and @brucellino are working on functionalt tests.

We also have a new collaborator : @desfroos - welcome aboard, Luca
